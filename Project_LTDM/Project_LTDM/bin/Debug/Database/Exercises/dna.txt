At the end of the road in Little Cottonwood Canyon, near Salt Lake City, Utah, lies Alta, a near-mythic location for skiing enthusiasts. In time, though, it may well achieve a similar status among molecular geneticists. In December 1984, a conference co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (or DOE) was held there, a conference that pondered a single question: Does modern DNA research offer a way of detecting tiny genetic mutations -- and, in particular, of observing any increase in the mutation rate among the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and their descendants? In short, the answer was, "Not yet;" however, in this atmosphere of intellectual fertility, the seeds were sown for a project that would make such detection possible in the future -- the Human Genome Project.
