Beware of viruses and hoaxes. A virus can't be transmitted through the body of an email. You need to have an executable program that you download from somewhere else to introduce a virus into your computer. A virus could be carried in any attached files you receive with your email. Make sure you use a current antivirus scanning software before running any attached files. And never open a file if you don't know the sender.
