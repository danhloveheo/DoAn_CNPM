I live in Vietnam and there are a lot of traffic problems in big cities in my country. Firstly, there are too many people using the roads especially in the rush hour when people run out to work and school or get home from those places. Secondly, there are too many vehicles on the road that leads to traffic jams. Another problem is that many roads are narrow and bumpy. Fourthly, there are traffic accidents every day so a lot of people lose their lives or are injured. So in order to travel on the roads safely, I think we should obey the traffic rules and traffic signs as well. Moreover, carefulness is very necessary.
