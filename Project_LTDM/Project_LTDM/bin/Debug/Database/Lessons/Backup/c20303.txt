Inasmuch as my grandfather is a pensioner, he has taken up gardening. the garden is a very beautiful landscape. It is separated from the outside by a hedge. It is located at the backyard of our house. At the entry of the garden there is a pretty pergola with little climbers on it. At the center of the garden stands a giant shade tree. Patio furniture consisting of wicker table and chairs is placed underneath this tree. I usually sit here playing chess with my grandfather. He plants several kinds of flowers like rose, gerbera, narcissus, cockscomb,... to make the garden colorful. He also spends a corner of the garden for vegetables supporting our meals. In other corner he puts some gardening tools like a watering can, spades, forks, clippers,... the thing I like the most is the birdhouse where plenty of birds come to nest. Everyday afterschool my grandfather together with me usually does the gardening works to keep the garden as before. It is of paramount importance to me and I love this garden so much.
