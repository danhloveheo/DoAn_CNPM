During childhood, I used to feed different kind of pet such as: hamster, dog, rabbit; however, I still like my cat the most. Her name is Katy. Her hair consists of three colors white, black and blonde. She has tiny ear, small nose and blue bright eyes, which can glow in the dark. Her hobbies is playing with colors wool rolls and catching mouse. Katy don’t really like cat food, she enjoy fish bone, rice and tiny shrimp. Although she eats less, she seems to be energetic all day long. Katy and I have great time being together. She is my best friend as she knows how is my inside feeling and sharing my sadness as well as happiness. Whenever I am not in good mood or in trouble, I hug her and feel a cosy breath that sweep all the disappointment. Every evening, I take her for a walk in a local park so that we can enjoy fresh air and she makes more friends with other cats. Cat is an easy-to-feed pet as it is small, obedient. In spite of laziness, it helps us relaxing, protecting house from some insects. Cat is not new to people but its feather is used to make out many cat fur coat and other items of fashion. It is highly recommend that government create a strict law banning on cat thief. Finally, cat is a cute animal; therefore, it needs to be protected and preserved from being eaten and illegally killed.
