How do you qualify to become an astronaut? 

The first step is to fill out an application, which you send to the Johnson Space Center, JSC in short, in Houston, Texas. There it will be reviewed and ranked according to height considerations, experience, and expertise, i.e. geologists, physicists, chemists, biologists etc. The competition is fierce. About four thousand individuals apply every two years, and the slots are limited.
